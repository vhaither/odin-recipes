    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The first time I made these easy cinnamon rolls, I made a mess and they STILL turned out! They are gone in 2 days at my house. Simple to make and super yummy.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (1 pound) loaf frozen bread dough, thawed</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
            <li>⅔ cup brown sugar</li>
            <li>½ cup chopped walnuts</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon water, or as needed</li>
            <li>⅓ cup heavy whipping cream</li>
            <li>⅔ cup sifted confectioners' sugar</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons milk</li>
            <li>1 dash vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Lightly grease 2 round cake pans with butter.</li>
            <li>Roll bread dough out to an 6x18-inch rectangle. Brush with melted butter. Combine brown sugar, walnuts, and cinnamon in a small bowl; sprinkle over butter. Roll dough into a log, starting at the long edge. Moisten edge with water and seal. Cut log into 20 slices; arrange rolls, cut sides down, in prepared cake pans. Cover with a towel and let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 90 minutes.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Pour heavy cream over dough.</li>
            <li>Bake in preheated oven until golden brown, about 25 minutes.</li>
            <li>Mix confectioners' sugar, milk, and vanilla extract in a small bowl; drizzle over warm cinnamon rolls to serve.</li>
        </ol>
